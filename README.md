# gxp
gxp - Graphical Copy Utility - for those who'd like to have fun in bash!

Setup
-------
Copy `gxp` into `/opt/gxp` so the binary becomes `/opt/gxp/gxp`.
Add `alias gxp=/opt/gxp/gxp` into `~/.bashrc`
Then issue `source ~/.bashrc`

Next time you open up a terminal use gxp name instead of cp:
`gxp myfile ~/mydir`
